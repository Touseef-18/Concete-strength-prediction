# Concete-strength-prediction
Predicts the Concrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals) considering cement blastFurnace flyAsh courseAggregate age using various ML algorithms like Linear regression, Random forest, XGBRegressor etc with best possible accuracy of approx 91 Percent.Also did EDA and used standard scalar function for standardization
